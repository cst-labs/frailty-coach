# Changelog

All notable product, design, and implementation changes to Frailty Coach are tracked here.

This project currently uses cache-busting app URLs such as `?v=65`; those are build/demo references, not semantic release versions.

## Unreleased

- Add future changes here before or during implementation.

## 2026-07-08 - Hackathon README Alignment

### Changed

- Updated README positioning for the Codex for Healthcare: From Prototype to Production hackathon.
- Added Healthy Longevity theme alignment, problem framing, solution loop, implemented scope, and prototype boundaries.

## 2026-07-08 - Flexible Assessment Timing

### Changed

- Reframed assessment as a flexible check-in: weekly is suggested, but users can save assessments anytime.
- Added last-assessment status to Today, with a check-in prompt only when the latest assessment is over 7 days old.
- Saving an assessment now records a dated Progress point; saving again on the same day updates that point.
- Progress now plots dated assessment points over the last 3 months instead of fixed weekly buckets.
- Updated Progress copy and change labels to compare against the earliest saved point in the last 3 months.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=65`.

## 2026-07-08 - Safety Copy Clarity Pass

### Changed

- Added **Before you start** context to the TUG setup checklist so users know why stable chair, clear path, and support nearby are shown.
- Clarified similar safety notes in Fall risk, Balance, Workout overview, active exercise, and paused workout states.
- Renamed the progress action **Do easy plan** to **Do today's easy plan**.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=63`.

## 2026-07-08 - Working Header Back Button

### Changed

- Replaced decorative header back arrows with a real **Back to Today** button.
- The button is hidden on Today and available on secondary app screens.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=62`.

## 2026-07-08 - Assessment TUG Label

### Changed

- Renamed the assessment title **Timed Up and Go** to **Timed Up and Go (TUG)** for clarity.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=61`.

## 2026-07-07 - Score More Info Modal

### Changed

- Simplified the Today **Function score** explanation so detailed copy is hidden behind **More info**.
- Added a small closeable score-information modal with the explanation, score meaning, and best next step.
- The modal can be closed with the close button, backdrop click, or Escape, then returns focus to the original button.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=60`.

## 2026-07-07 - Progress Score Clarity

### Changed

- Progress insight now shows the current **Function score** by itself, without combining it with a delta.
- Added a separate **Score change** row with plain-language wording such as `3 points lower`.
- Renamed detailed progress deltas so they read as changes, not current values.
- Tightened the collapsed **View detailed trend** disclosure so it no longer leaves a large blank area.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=59`.

## 2026-07-07 - Workout Completion State Fix

### Fixed

- Fixed the Today screen showing **Workout reminder** after the user completed the final workout exercise.
- Final exercise completion now immediately records the workout as done for today.
- Changed the completion screen primary action from **Mark workout done** to **Back to Today** because completion is now automatic.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=56`.

## 2026-07-07 - Progress Steps Delta Fix

### Fixed

- Fixed Progress screen **Steps** change rendering `NaN`.
- Steps now compare the current wearable step count against the selected profile's seeded baseline.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=55`.

## 2026-07-07 - Workout Pause and Stop Controls

### Added

- Added **Pause workout** controls to active exercise, setup/safety, and rest screens.
- Added a paused workout state with a saved exercise, rep/set progress, and resume action.

- Today now shows a paused-workout status and a **Resume workout** primary action when a workout is paused.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=54`.

## 2026-07-07 - Workout Completion Artwork Framing

### Fixed

- Fixed the workout completion illustration so the full person is visible and the head is no longer cropped.
- Clipped the source artwork corners cleanly while preserving the full figure.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=53`.

## 2026-07-07 - Plain-Language Score Coaching

### Added

- Added a score interpretation panel below the Today screen Function score.
- The panel explains that the score represents movement reserve across walking, standing strength, balance, daily activity, and recovery.
- Added band-specific encouragement and a clear next step focused on the user's weakest domain.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=51`.

## 2026-07-07 - Set-Aware Workout Counter

### Fixed

- Fixed exercise counters so doses like `2 sets of 6` require both sets before moving to rest or the next exercise.
- Changed **Reps complete** to complete the current set first; it only advances after the final set is complete.
- Added set labels to the workout counter, such as `Set 1 of 2` and `Set 2 of 2`.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=49`.

## 2026-07-07 - Fresh Startup Defaults

### Changed

- Moved mutable app/profile numbers out of persistent browser storage.
- Fresh app startups now always start from the fixed seeded profile defaults.
- Changes made during a running demo, including saved assessments, completed workouts, and four-week simulation, still persist in memory while the app remains open.
- Refreshing or reopening the app resets profile numbers back to the default seeds.
- Kept coach avatar preference in persistent local storage as a user preference.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=48`.

## 2026-07-07 - Assessment Stepper Icon Polish

### Changed

- Replaced abstract assessment-step glyphs with clearer inline SVG icons for Safety, Fall risk, Walk, Strength, and Save.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=46`.

## 2026-07-07 - Daily-Use Workout Flow and v2 UI Refinement

### Added

- Added Today-screen workout completion state:
  - Before completion, Today shows a workout reminder.
  - After completion, Today shows "Workout done today", an encouragement note, and a **View progress** primary action.
  - Workout completion is recorded once per local day to avoid duplicate adherence, step, or active-minute inflation.
- Added a guided workout-session flow:
  - Workout overview.
  - Active exercise screen.
  - Setup and safety detail view.
  - Rest screen.
  - Completion screen.
- Added separate rep actions:
  - **Mark rep** increments one rep.
  - **Reps complete** immediately fills the required rep count.
  - Rep controls disable once reps are complete.
  - **Reset counter** allows the user to restart the current exercise counter.
- Added automatic rest after exercise completion:
  - Completing the required reps immediately opens the rest screen.
  - Default rest is now 60 seconds.
  - **Add 1 min rest** extends rest by one minute per tap.
  - **Skip rest and start next** moves directly to the next exercise.
- Added guarded storage helpers so the app can still render in embedded/private contexts where `localStorage` may be unavailable.
- Added regression coverage for once-per-day workout completion.

### Changed

- Reworked Today around the daily habit loop:
  - Daily workout is the primary action.
  - Assessment is positioned as weekly or as-needed.
  - Non-critical score and wearable details are hidden behind disclosures.
- Improved workout-completion artwork framing so the completion screen no longer shows an awkward tall crop.
- Updated rest behavior from a short 45-second timer to a more conservative 60-second starting rest for older/frail users.
- Versioned `logic.js` through the service-worker cache list to avoid stale module exports during demo testing.
- Bumped the running demo reference to `?v=45`.

### Fixed

- Fixed the workflow where **Mark workout done** stayed on the completion screen instead of returning to Today.
- Fixed repeated workout-completion taps double-counting adherence/activity for the same day.
- Fixed stale service-worker/module caching issues that could cause newly added logic exports to be unavailable.
- Fixed rest timer behavior so it starts immediately after exercise completion instead of requiring an extra **Start rest** tap.
